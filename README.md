# Discuss-o-matic

A small tool to help facilitate and guide group discussions.


## Dependencies

For development, you'll first need nodejs. Then install the npm package `meteorite` and [Meteor][meteor] itself.

To deploy, you'll just need the Heroku command-line tools.

[meteor]: https://www.meteor.com/


## Deploying to Heroku

Make sure you're logged in to Heroku. Clone the repository, then set up a Heroku instance using [oortcloud's Meteor buildpack][oortcloud-meteor]:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/davidhollis/discuss.git
cd discuss/
heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack https://github.com/oortcloud/heroku-buildpack-meteorite.git
```

Make a note of the URL that Heroku assigns, then configure the instance:

```shell
heroku config:add ROOT_URL=(the URL that Heroku assigned)
```

From there, you're ready to push.

```shell
git push heroku master
```

Because the buildpack automatically adds the
MongoDB development add-on, you'll need to have [verified your account][heroku-verify]. Don't worry, though; the add-on is free.
